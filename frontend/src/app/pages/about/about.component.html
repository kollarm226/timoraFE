      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of developers and enthusiasts for modern digital solutions who believe that vacation planning
        should not be stressful. Our goal is to bring a simple, secure and reliable way for employees to manage
        their time off, and for employers to efficiently track requests and plan capacities with a clear overview.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that organisations are successful when they truly listen to people – both those on the front line
        and those in the offices. That is why we created Timora Vacation Planner: to make communication between
        employees and managers easier and to simplify the entire vacation approval process.

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>
        We work in short development sprints and closely cooperate with our users. New features are tested in real
        use as soon as possible while keeping the whole system stable. A modern CI/CD pipeline and a strong focus
        on code quality are a natural part of our process.
